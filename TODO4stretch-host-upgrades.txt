update_jdn.sh
-------------
refactor some apt-get install calls away (which used to be needed because of jessie-backportsâ€¦)


open problems
-------------
- dsa-check-packages points to /bin/true on hosts running in the future
- compare sshd_config from stretch with the one we're using (from jessie)

no i386 kernels on i386
-----------------------
because of:
#866314: linux-image-4.9.0-3-686-pae: 100+ times slower disk writes on 4.x+/i386/16+RAM, compared to 3.x
amd64 kernel was manually installed with multiarch, should go into update_jdn
also on pb3+4+9 I had to do: sudo apt install linux-image-amd64


to be done once all hosts run stretch: sshd_config
--------------------------------------------------
/etc/ssh/sshd_config - the currently running one is the one from jessie, we should update_jdn to the one from stretch
